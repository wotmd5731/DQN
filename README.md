# DQN
Created by Pytorch

DQN Learning using numerical values returned from Cartpole 
I have completed applying the basic classic system ( CartPole-v1 , Acrobot-v1, MountainCar-v0 ).


the default setting is CartPole system.
x : position of cart on the track
θ : angle of the pole with the vertical
dx/dt : cart velocity
dθ/dt : rate of change of the angle

Dueling DQN
- dueling network represents two separate estimators: 
  one for the state value function and one for the state-dependent action advantage function.

Deep Recurrent Q Network (DRQN) using LSTM
- lstm is learned using last state , that returned the sequectial experience memory.
- but not conrrectly work. It works but do not learn.

Multi-step DQN w/o Replay memory 
- n step learning , w/o memory , Using TD Error , Propotional PER 
- There is no experience memory, so can not efficiently learning.
